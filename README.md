Latest version 1.9.7 by TheCodingChihuahua
Spotify Infinite Scroller is styled to fit right in to Spotify's UI

First release!

1.9.7 has:
- Infinite scroller
- Toggle button in bottom right corner, press to switch infinite scrolling on/off
- Toggle button changes the mouse pointer to "select" when hovered
- Super easy-to-read debug in the console

To-do:
- Settings for where the toggle button is (maybe)
- Toggle button gets a little bigger when hovered
- Toggle button becomes partly transparent except when hovered (turn off in hypothetical settings)

I'm open for suggestions! Add suggestions or bugs in Issues tab!
Thanks for reading!
